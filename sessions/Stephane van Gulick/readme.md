Stephane presented two talks at the PSConfEu 2019:

- Learning Class with Class {}

## Creating beatiful websites using PSHTML and Polaris

In this talk, Stephane teaches how you can create HTML reports using [PSTHML](https://github.com/Stephanevg/pshtml) a Powershell web rendering language.
PSHTML allows one to reproduces the HTML language structure, while using all of the Powershell's strength to perform logical operations (Foreach, While, functions, load external modules etc..)

Stephane demonstrates how [PSTHML](https://github.com/Stephanevg/pshtml) can be useful to generate static reports, including graphical elements such as Charts, up to creating a full web application when combined with Polaris.

Install `PSHTML` using the following command

```powershell
Install-module PSHTML
```
